## Algorithms
 - VCV Rack generative
 - Markov Model
 - Generative grammars
 - Transition networks
 - Chaos theory
 - Genetic algorithms
 - Cellular Automata
 - Neural networks
 - Artificial Intelligence
 - Visualization
   - Could use pyAudioAnalysis or librosa python libraries

## Presentation
 - History in 2 minutes
 - Controlled randomness
   - Use VCV rack generative, augment with python
 - EEG example
   - Music to increase relaxation
   - Watch horror sequence with EEG, make it generate scary sounds like Thrill EEG or change volumes on various scary parts
 - Genetic algorithms
   - Show GSO cinematic piece I wrote, generate a varation on it
   - This is the technique used by Avia
 - Deep learning
   - Google example of getting MIDI from piano audio
   - Use it to train model to generate relaxing piano music
 - A philisophical point on computers and creativity

## Other
 - Produce piece like this for modular: https://youtu.be/4GnVDPD01as
 - Implement each technique in the book
 - YouTube channel
 - OpenAI jukebox to generate samples instead of entire songs
 - OpenAI jukebox to generate kick samples. Parameters for amount of high end, low end, length, etc. Add parameters to training data by analyzing individual samples.
 - Deep learning reconstruct vocal high end (could be used for lots of different plugins)
