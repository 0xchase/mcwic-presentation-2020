# Todo

### Schedule
 - This week: Controlled randomness, deep learning
 - Week 2: Genetic algorithm example
 - Week 3: Markov Model, GAN

---

### History
 - Create presentation format
 - 5 minute overview from the Algorithmic Composition book

### Controlled Randomness
 - VCVRack demo
 - Moog Mother 32 Demo
 - Nodal

### Markov Model
 - Get basic markov model working

### ??? Algorithms
 - Show what I'm working on for the Galen game
 - Show how algorithms can be used to generate variations

### Deep Learning
 - Get basic deep learning working (using git:rileynwong/lstm-jazz)
 - Generate new midi files from ambient piano pieces
 - Deep learning to train model and generate new songs

### GAN for sampling
 - Get basic GAN working
 
### Future technologies
 - Show EEG data example
 - Cognitive science
   - Demonstrate how each algorithm captures the semantics of each musical property
 - Generative grammars - by Noam Chomsky, everyone's favorite linguist and anti-neoliberal

### Conclusion
 - A group of students will be working on this project, so if you're intersted you can DM me or send an email to chasekanipe@gmail.com, and you can join our research
